## How to Play
### Your Mission
Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to move your character across the road to the water. Enemies will hurdle across the screen at you during your quest, and if they hit you, you'll end up back on the grass with -1 life.

### The Rules
  * There are infinite levels, and you increase by 1 level every time you reach the water
  * You have three lives. If you lose them all, you go back to level 1 :(
  * Every three levels you get another life!
  * The number of enemies increases by one for every level-up.
  * You get 10 points for every level you get to, and these points do not matter in any way!

### Controls
  * Press `up` to move up
  * Press `down` to move down
  * Press `left` to move left
  * Press `right` to move right
